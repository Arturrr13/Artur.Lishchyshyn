Our template integrates questions from this online personality test example into a series of sliding bar graphics. If you’re confused as to what the sliders mean, check out the Myers Briggs basics article.

                    In the beginning, It’s just about brainstorming.
                    <br><br>
                    I list out a jumble of words and draw tiny sketches related to what I’m working on (and find the parallels later). Personally, I prefer paper with a grid so I can convey things responsively. Most of the time perfection isn’t an issue and the sketches are just for me.

                    I played with adding a wireframe of the website flow that would lead you in to each screen. For each of those screens I added a floating footer that allows users to see where they are in that particular flow and jump around as needed.” We’re digging this InVision-made wireframe.
